Please run these programs in the following order in different terminals
0. Compile runner.c
1. ./runner
2. ./server
3. ./s1
4. ./s2
5. ./s3
6. ./client (as many clients as needed)

Note: There are only three servers s1-s3, and only one proxy service. Others can be easily added, so there are only those many to show an example.
